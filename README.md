# SportsVoice AI - Sports Interview Generator

A full-stack application that transforms athletes into professional sports interviewers using Runway's Act Two API. Upload your favorite athlete video and a professional interview reference, and create custom sports content with AI-powered performance transfer.

## Workflow

1. **Upload Athlete**: User uploads video of their favorite sports player
2. **Upload Interview Style**: User uploads professional interview/presenter reference
3. **AI Processing**: Backend calls Runway Act Two API to transfer interview style to athlete
4. **Monitor**: Real-time status updates via polling
5. **Download**: User receives custom sports interview content

## Video Requirements & Limitations

### ‚úÖ **What Works Best**
- **Resolution**: 720p (1280x720) or higher recommended
- **Duration**: 2-10 seconds optimal
- **Face Requirements**: 
  - Clear, front-facing faces
  - Good lighting (not dark or shadowy)
  - Faces should fill a significant portion of the frame
  - Minimal motion blur
- **Format**: MP4 with H.264 codec
- **Content**: Talking head videos, interviews, press conferences, award ceremonies

### ‚ùå **Common Issues**
- **Low Resolution**: Videos below 720p often fail face detection
- **Poor Lighting**: Dark or poorly lit faces won't be detected
- **Fast Motion**: Sports action shots with motion blur
- **Wide Shots**: Faces too small in the frame
- **Profile Views**: Side-angle faces (need front-facing)
- **Obstructed Faces**: Masks, sunglasses, or partial coverage

### üéØ **Best Practices**
- **Test with phone recordings**: Modern phone cameras work great
- **Use interview/press conference footage**: These typically have ideal face positioning
- **Avoid sports action clips**: Use post-game interviews instead
- **Debug tip**: Upload the same video for both character and reference to test if it has a detectable face

### üîß **Troubleshooting**
If you get "No face found" errors:
1. Check video resolution (should be 720p+)
2. Ensure faces are clearly visible and well-lit
3. Try the same video for both inputs to isolate which video is problematic
4. Record a simple selfie video as a test case

## Runway API Integration

Using Runway's Act Two model for character performance transfer:
- Model: `act_two` via `character_performance` endpoint
- Transfers facial expressions and movements between videos
- Input formats: MP4, WebM, MOV (max 16MB)
- Output ratio: 1280:720 (HD sports broadcast format)
- Face detection required in both character and reference videos
